          I would like to welcome all of the family, friends, staff, and faculty that are here to support our 
          graduates. Today is an incredibly exciting day, and we should take a moment to reflect on our 
          journey. Some of us came straight from high school, some transferred here from community 
          colleges and others have been here for more than four years. The bottom line is that we have all 
          completed our degrees. No matter how long we have been at SSP, and what struggles we have 
          gone through to earn our diplomas, we should be proud of ourselves. We’ve finally made it!

          Five years ago, I moved here to attend college. I was just a boy from Comoros with some 
          family that lived in Comoros. I didn’t know anyone at the Faculty of Engineering (SSP), nor did I understand 
          what computer science and engineering really involved. Well now we know, or at least our professors hope we do.
